# Light shaft

Screen-space light shafts (aka god ray or crepuscular ray) are generated by first rendering the light source with its respective color and the objects as black (image 1,`PreLightShaft`). Then a radial blur effect is done for it so that the light source is at the center of the blur (image 2, `PostLightShaft`). This radial blur pass creates the light shafts which are then combined to the final image (image 3, `LightShaftApp`). This is a screenspace effect so it's relatively cheap but of course very dependent on how the light sources are visible in the frame.
