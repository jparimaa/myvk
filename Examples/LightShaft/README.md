# Light shaft

Screen-space light shafts (aka god ray or crepuscular ray) are generated by first rendering the light source with its respective color and the objects as black (`LightShaftPrepass`). Then the objects are rendered with the desired textures and lighting (`ObjectRenderPass`). For the sake of simplicity in this example there is a simple texturing with no lighting. The results of both of these passes are stored in their own images. These images are the input for the light shaft pass. A radial blur effect is done for the first image so that the light source is at the center of the blur. The radial blur creates the light shafts which are then combined with the object render pass image for the final image. This is a screenspace effect so it's relatively cheap but of course very dependent on how the light sources are visible in the frame.
